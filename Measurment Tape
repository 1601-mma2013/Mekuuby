MR SAM 
AN ENERGETIC AND TALENTED MAN IN HIS LATE 50s OWNS A CONSTRUCTING COMPANY. 
THE FACT THAT IN MOST CASES HE WORKS FROM HOME, HE ALWAYS ASSURES THAT HIS WORKERS ARE BEING MANAGED AND THAT THE WORK IS CARRIED OUT EFFECTIVELY.
SINCE HE IS A DISABLED MAN WITH ONLY ONE ARM, 
IT DOESN’T DETER HIM FROM DOING HIS JOB. SO ONE DAY HE WANTED TO ORDER A BELT FOR HIS SON FROM ONLINE,
SINCE HE WASN’T SURE OF HIS SONS WAIST HE SIMPLY JUST SWITCHED ON THE BAGEL’S WHEEL MODE AND ROLL THE WHEEL AROUND HIS WAIST.
IN ADDITION,
SINCE HE DOESN’T LIKE TO BE SEEN INCAPABLE,
HE SOMETIMES DOES HIS EMPLOYERS WORK USING BAGELS REMOTE TO MEASURE THE WALLS AND CEILLLINGS.
MR SAM EXPERIENCES PROBLEMS WHEN COMES TO MEASURING LONG OR TALL OBJECTS BECAUSE OF HIS HEIGHT
SO HE COULD NOT REACH THE HIGH CEILING.
HE IS ALSO GETS CLUMBSY AR TIMES, ONE DAY HE DROPPED THE BAGEL IN TO A BUCKET OF WATER THEN IT STOPPPED WORKING.
