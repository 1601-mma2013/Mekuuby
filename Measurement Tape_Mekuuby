**Smart Measurement Tape**

**I. Analysis**

**1. Research**

**a. Scope**

1.    Objectives

            To help people measure,organize, and analyse any measurement in smart way. Evolved to serve the needsof today's consumer. Our goal with the Bagel is to offer users an easier way tomeasure anything – be it room dimensions for a home improvement project,precise inseam length for the tricky task of online ordering, or muscle gainsfor fitness enthusiasts.

From this what are we trying toimprove is the durability of the product for users and also to improve inaspect of design, materials and costing. In aspect of design, what we aretargeting is the handling of the gadget and also for the cost is not tooexpensive. For materials is how the gadget can be handle in any situation foran example; shock resistance and water resistance.

**a. ContextScenarios**

A sample context scenario

The following isthe first iteration of a context scenario for a primary persona for a personaldigital assistant (PDA) type phone, including both the device and its service.Our persona is Vivien Strong, a real-estate agent in Indianapolis, whose goalsare to balance work and home life, close the deal, and make each client feellike he or she is her only client.

Here is Sam’s contextscenario:

 

1-     Every morning he wakes up and do his daily routine,on his off day he always be in his room and do his hobby as a crafter. He likesto make stuff like building his kids toy car or tree house. He use begalmeasurement tape to measure the length and width for his project. There is 3types of method he can use to measure so it would not be a problem to him doinghis hobby.

2-     One day when he woke up, the wife informed himthat she need a big dining table big enough for the family and guests. So Mr.Sam quickly measures the dining room size and send the readings to his wife’sphone wife through bluetooth. Then she quickly rushed to the furniture shop tobuy her dining table.

3-     On his way to work, since he always drive pasthis neighbor house, the neighbor told Mr. Sam that they are planning to buildtheir new born baby a bedroom so they need his help to measure the room, sincehe was a bit in a hurry, he promised to come do it the next day since it was apublic holiday. So the next day he went to help them out, it was so fast sincehe quickly just used the sensor to measure the length of distance and all wasready. After he finished helping the neighbours, he drove back home and itstarted to rain all              of asudden…since he was driving his Land Cruiser, he forgot to put on his canopy soall his  tools were at the back under thewater since the rain was quite heavy. Later  whenhe went to check if everything is ok with an angry face, luckily andsurprisingly enough his precious Bagel was still in good condition because it’smade to stand harsh conditions and he didn’t know about it.

4-     Mr sam was measuring the ceiling for decorationfor his house when the begal fall and hit the ground but luckly the bageldevice do not scratch a bit.

2. - Information:
   - Functions: 

            Bagelhas three modes. String mode allows users to simply pull out Bagel's unmarkedstring to measure length. Bagel's patented sensor technology calculates length,and the measurement instantly appears on screen. In wheel mode, users can holdthe Bagel in one hand and roll it on any surface, including curves, to seemeasurements on the digital display. Perfect for measuring walls or ceilingsthat are difficult to reach, in remote mode, users point to what they needmeasured, and Bagel's ultrasonic sensor computes the distance between the tapemeasure and the object being measured. The digital display then immediatelydisplays the distance.
